Version control for our programs and processor architecture files

In order to use our processor, use the sv files stored in systemVerilog files. These will include all the sv files needed for modules, and also has several test benches. 

When simulating a test bench, be sure to include the appropriate machine code txt files in your folder as well as the test txt files. These are required for the test benches to run properly.
